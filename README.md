# Docker Container for kubernetes api code generation for the go programming language

This is a somewhat helper program to make code generation a bit more repeatable

## Usage

See sample.sh for a sample script where the api is defined in `api/sampleproject` .. with say `api/sampleproject/v1alpha1` being a folder, etc.
